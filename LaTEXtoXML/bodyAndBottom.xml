So far, the control systems of this kindare widely used in modern aircraft. As the statistic documents show, flybywire control systems are more sensitive to external EMI than theiranalog predecessors. ucite 1 The typical EMI sources are divided into twotypesone comes from nature such as lightning and the other originates fromhuman beings such as high intensity radiated fields(HIRF). As largepowerradars and radio transmitters are commonly used for aircraftcommunications, monitoring, and other electronic systems, it becomes more andmore common that HIRF is injected on modern digital aircraft systems. Typically, HIRF is emanated from modern communication equipment likebroadcast towers, radars, and pointtopoint radio links. As is well known, computers deal with binary data. Then HIRF might change the bits of thecritical control computer and thus induces communication to be disrupted, control surfaces to spuriously move, etc. They could result in most seriousterrible consequences such as the loss of control and even severe threat ofthe aircraft safety. Therefore, the effects from EMI gradually attract theattention of more and more researchers to the topics of aircraft stabilityand performance analysis from system level under these kinds ofenvironments. As indicated by the literature, the benefits of the aircraftsredundancy design are apparently reduced due to the commonmode faultstriggered by EMI, ucite 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 in addition, aircraft performance responsesare degraded. In general, the performance of a complex control system can becompletely described by the aircraft dynamics and the corresponding controllaw utilized under nominal operating conditions. However, the system willswitch to another mode under abnormal operating conditions. Therefore, adegradation of control performance could be generated and observed becausethe control system will switch between nominal and abnormal conditions backand forth frequently when EMI happens to the system. Then, it forms a jumplinear system driven by the stochastic switching signal. Consequently, thispaper develops a distributed computing platform to observe and analyze thisperformance degradation and stability of the system under the adverseconditions. In this paper, we use the stochastic method to describe EMIevents and develop the mathematic model to describe the flight controlsystem performance degradation. In addition, stability analysis of thesystem is also a focus in this paper. Therefore, the characteristics of theintegrated analysis model in this paper are to combine the embedded digitalsystem with the control law implementation, the dynamics of the closedloopsystems and the harsh environments. Correspondingly, the integratedperformance measurable index is a complex function of harsh environmentevent processes, the computing platform design choices, the aircraftdynamics, etc. Malfunction effect researches on flight control systems induced by harshelectromagnetic environments have been considered, and have attracted moreresearchers for several years. For example, it is proposed that themodelling and analyzing method be constructed for a closedloop systemperformance under digital upsets. ucite 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 Specifically, introduced inRef.  <citref rids="ref2">2</citref> was a hybrid performance model for a digital flight control systemsubject to random upsets. A distributed recoverable computing platformtopology was proposed which had been inspired mostly by the computerarchitectures known as scalable processorindependent design for enhancedreliability(SPIDER). Correspondingly, the ROBUS computer communication systemwas used on the SPIDER. ucite 12 , 13 A complete performance estimationmethod was developed for the control system experiencing digital upsetprocesses. Meansquare stability(MSS)principles were employed on thismethod. Reference <citref rids="ref3">3</citref> provided a performance model which was applied to aBoeing 747  model. References <citref rids="ref4">4</citref> and <citref rids="ref5">5</citref> described a physical HIRFexperiment conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center. The statisticalanalyses of the collected data from the experiments showed that Markovprocess characteristics can proximately describe the upset process in theliterature. Correspondingly, stability analyses for the stochastic jumplinear systems were also developed by many researchers. ucite 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 Thepresent paper employs mean square stability to analyze the jump linearsystem stability characteristics. Compared with the previous work, thispaper makes two contributions. First, this paper proposes more completeindependent upset stochastic process injected into the control system indetail and provides the theoretical method to analyze the processing unitswith various upset injection processes cases. These processes are regardedas the switching signals coming from the computing platform model. The paperconsiders the general Markov upset processes, zeroorder Markov processes, also known as the independent and identically distributed(IID)process withMarkov format and IID processes with known upset probability as the switchingsignal injected into the digital control system. Second, a more completeperformance model analysis method is also developed especially under thesekinds of upset processes directly injected into the distributed controlsystem. The rest of the present paper is organized as follows. The performancemodelling theorems for the distributed control systems subject to theindependent digital upsets are introduced in Section 2 . In this section, the distributed recoverable computing platform is presented briefly, a performancemodel of the flight control system is also proposed, and the theorems fortracking error performance with three types of upset processes aresummarized as well. In Section 3 , theoretical and simulation estimationvalidation examples and additional trials are provided in order to verifythe complete performance model. Some conclusions are drawn from the presentstudy in Section 4 . </p></section><section><title>Performance modelling and theoretical analysis of distributed control system with independent digital upsets</title>

In the presentpaper, CPEs are used to calculate the updates of control law in the sampleperiod, and RMUs are used to coordinate the communications between the PEs, which guarantees to provide full and reliable messages. BIUs provide theinterface between PEs and the whole communication system. IO PE acts as aninputoutput interface to the actuators. In practical application, theprocessing units, CPEs and RMUs, are offtheshelf devicesmoredetails about the hardware implementation can be found in Refs.  <citref rids="ref6">6</citref> ,  <citref rids="ref7">7</citref> , and <citref rids="ref8">8</citref> . This part has been further studied in Refs.  <citref rids="ref2">2</citref> and <citref rids="ref3">3</citref> . In thepresent paper, analyses are based on several assumptions that are statedbelow. (i)The upset processes<equ id="equ6" type="inline">

are independent homogeneous Markovchains(HMCs)or IID processes comprised of binary random variables withcertain transition probability matrices or upset probabilities for theprocesses. (ii)Each CPE has the same control law. (iii)Each ROBUS node(CPEBIU, RMU)can transmit data when no internal upset isdetected. This function detection is assumed not to fail. (iv)Each ROBUS node is independent in a certain region. (v)The state of each CPE, <equ id="equ8" type="inline">
