Abstract
</title>
<p id="2">
 Recent research has focused on the monitoring of globalscale online data for improved detection of epidemics, mood patterns, movements in the stock market political revolutions, boxoffice revenues, consumer behaviour and many other important phenomena. However, privacy considerations and the sheer scale of data available online are quickly making global monitoring infeasible, and existing methods do not take full advantage of local network structure to identify key nodes for monitoring. Here, we develop a model of the contagious spread of information in a globalscale, publiclyarticulated social network and show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but advance warning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly choose a small fraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly choose a �friend� of each node to include in a group for local monitoring. Using six months of data from most of the full Twittersphere, we show that this friend group is more central in the network and it helps us to detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel hashtags about 7  days earlier than we could with an equalsized randomly chosen group. Moreover, the method actually works better than expected due to network structure alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit increased diversity in the information they transmit to others. These results suggest that local monitoring is not just more efficient, but also more effective, and it may be applied to monitor contagious processes in globalscale networks.

Introduction
</title>
<p id="3">
 Modern social, informational, and transactional platforms offer a means for information to spread naturally(e. g, as in the case of theArab Spring <citref rids="ref1">

</citref>
 ), and there is increasing interest in using these systems to intentionally promote the spread of information and behavior <citref rids="ref2 ref3 ref4 ref5">
2-5
</citref>
    . In addition, they also yield a brandnew and largescale global view of social interactions and dynamics of formerly hidden phenomena <citref rids="ref6">

</citref>
  and many other important phenomena. However, the advent of global monitoring has recently heightened concerns about privacy <citref rids="ref17">
17
</citref>
 , and anonymization is often insufficient to guarantee it <citref rids="ref18">
18
</citref>
 . Thus, future efforts to monitor global phenomena may be restricted to analysis at a local scale <citref rids="ref10 ref19">
10,19
</citref>
  or to incomplete pictures of the system. Moreover, the explosive growth of online data has made it more and more difficult to perform a complete global analysis. As a result, scholars are beginning to develop local methods that sample small but relevant parts of the system <citref rids="ref20 ref21">
20,21
</citref>
  . 
</p>
<p id="4">
Here, we elaborate the theoretical framework of <citref rids="ref22">
22
</citref>
 sampling technique to take advantage of the local structure inherent in largescale online social networks, to allow monitoring of a network without relying on a complete picture of the systemand we use it to test an important hypothesis about nonbiological social contagion. 
</p>
<p id="5">
If a message is transmitted exogenously via<emph type="italic">
broadcast
</emph>
, then all individuals are equally likely to receive it, regardless of their position in the network. On the other hand, if a message is transmitted endogenously from person to person to person via<emph type="italic">
contagion
</emph>
, then individuals at the center of a network are likely to receive it sooner than randomlychosen members of the population because central individuals are a smaller number of steps(degrees of separation)away from the average individual in the network <citref rids="ref22 ref23">
22,23
</citref>
  . As a result, for contagious processes, we would expect the Sshaped cumulativeepidemic curve <citref rids="ref24">
24
</citref>
 to be shifted to the left(forward in time)for centrally located individuals compared to the population as a whole. 
</p>
<p id="6">
If so, then the careful collection of information from a sample of central individuals within human social networks could be used to detect contagious outbreaks before they happen in the population at large <citref rids="ref22">
22
</citref>
 . We call this the<emph type="italic">
sensor hypothesis
</emph>
. In fact, the very discrepancy in the time to infection between central and randomlychosen individuals could serve as a means to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous mechanisms, either<emph type="italic">

by comparing their mean times of infection or in real time by looking for the first day in which there is a significant divergence in their cumulative incidences.

Results

<p id="7">
 Using 6  months of data from Twitter recorded in 2009  <citref rids="ref25">
25
</citref>
 , we analyze a network containing 40  million users around the world who are connected by 1.5  billion directed relationships(follows). Over six months, these users sent nearly half a billion messages(tweets), of which 67  million contained a usersupplied topic keyword called ahashtag. These hashtags are prefixed by a pound sign(��)and are used to denote unique people, events, or ideas, making them useful for studying the spread of information online <citref rids="ref26 ref27 ref28">
26-28
</citref>
   . 
</p>
<p id="8">
To test the sensor hypothesis, we need a sample of individuals with higher network centrality(thesensorgroup)to compare with a sample of randomly chosen individuals(thecontrolgroup). However, measuring centrality can be a computationally expensive task in largescale networks like Twitter(see SI). Therefore, we use a simplified approach that first randomly selects a set of users for the control group, and then randomly choosesfriendsof members of this group to put in an equallysized sensor group. This procedure generates a sensor group with higher degree centrality than the control group because of thefriendship paradoxhighdegree individuals are more likely to be connected to a randomly chosen person than lowdegree individuals <citref rids="ref22 ref29">
22,29
</citref>
  . In other words, your friends have more friends than you do.  <citref rids="ref30">

</citref>
 
</p>
<p id="9">
In Fig. <xref>
panel1
</xref>
 a we demonstrate that the sensor group contains more high degree individuals and fewer low degree individuals, and this is true even if we remove duplicates from the sensor group(duplicates occur when the same person is randomly chosen as a friend by multiple individuals in the control group). However, this difference between the sensor and control groups depends on what fraction of the network is sampled. As the fraction increases, there is increasing overlap between the two groups, reducing the difference in their degree distributions(Fig. <xref>
panel1
</xref>
 b). We derive closed form equations that characterize the expected degree distribution for both the sensor groups(with and without duplicates)and control groups based on the fraction of nodes sampled and an arbitrary known degree distribution for the network as a whole(see SIAn Analytic Elaboration of the Friendship Paradox). Fig. <xref>
panel1
</xref>
 c, d show that these equations fit the data well for a random sample of 1.25 of all users(500 , 000  total)on Twitter, confirming our expectation that the sensor group is more central than the control group.

<p id="10">
To test whether sensors can provide early warning of a contagious message spreading through the network, suppose<equ id="equ2" type="inline">

denotes the time at which a sampled user<inline-graphic id="g3" href="C:\Users\VKU3744\Desktop\LaTEX\LaTEXtoXML\mainmain\mainmain-formula-3.png"/>
first mentions hashtag<equ id="equ4" type="inline">

</equ>
(i. e the infection time). We would expect<equ id="equ5" type="inline">
<tex>

to be smaller on average for users belonging to a central sensor group<inline-graphic id="g6" href="C:\Users\VKU3744\Desktop\LaTEX\LaTEXtoXML\mainmain\mainmain-formula-6.png"/>
than for those of a random control group<inline-graphic id="g7" href="C:\Users\VKU3744\Desktop\LaTEX\LaTEXtoXML\mainmain\mainmain-formula-7.png"/>

for hashtag<equ id="equ9" type="inline">

</equ>
, the sensor hypothesis is that<equ id="equ10" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha<0$
</tex>

</equ>
. 
</p>
<p id="11">
However, note that<equ id="equ11" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
depends on the size of the samples in two ways. For small samples, the number ofinfectedusers(i. e. users mentioning hashtag<equ id="equ12" type="inline">
<tex>
$\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
)will be scarce, leading to large statistical errors. On the other hand, for big samples, the degree distribution of the control and sensor groups tend to overlap and consequently<equ id="equ13" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
approaches 0 . Therefore, it may be necessary to find an optimalGoldilockssample size that gives statistical power while still preserving the highcentrality characteristic of the sensor group. Fig. <xref>
panel2
</xref>
 a shows results from a theoretical simulation of an infection <citref rids="ref31">

</citref>
 spreading in a synthetic network(see SISensor Performance in a Simulated Infection Model)while Fig. <xref>
panel2
</xref>
 b shows an empirical analysis of widely used hashtags in our Twitter database(see SISensor Performance in Real Data). Both theory and data suggest that there exists an optimal(and moderate)sample size that may perform best for detecting large and significant differences between the sensor and control group resulting from contagious processes. 
</p>
<p id="12">
To analyze the performance of the sensor mechanism, we collected five random control samples of 50 , 000  users and a random set of their followees of the same size to use as sensors for each one. Focusing on the 32  most widespread hashtags that appear at least 10  times in each control sample, Fig. <xref>
panel2
</xref>
 c shows that<equ id="equ14" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
is negative(i. e. , the sensor sample uses the hashtag prior to the control sample)in all but two cases, with a mean for all hashtags of �7. 1  days(SEM 1.1  days). In the SIUsing the Sensor Method with a Small Set of Samples, we also show this distribution for a wider range of hashtags, and these all show that<equ id="equ15" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
tends to be negative. In other words, the sensor groups provide advance warning of the usage of a wide variety of hashtags. 
</p>
<p id="13">
We also hypothesized that comparative monitoring of a sensor group and a control group may help distinguish which hashtags are spreading virally via a contagious process and which are spreading via broadcast. We studied 24  hashtags(Fig. <xref>
panel3
</xref>
 a)that werebornduring our sample period(they first appeared at least 25  days after the start date of data collection)and then became widely used(they were eventually used more than 20 , 000  times). Notably, the users using these hashtags tended to be highly connected and many were connected to a giant component, a sign that the hashtags may have spread virally online from user to user(see Fig. <xref>
panel3
</xref>
 d and Fig. S11 to S14 of the SI for more examples). 
</p>
<p id="14">
For each of these hashtag networks, we constructed a random control sample of 5 its size and a similarlysized sensor sample of their followees to calculate<equ id="equ16" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
. We then repeated this process 1 , 000  times to generate a statistical distribution of these observed lead times(as in Fig. <xref>
panel2
</xref>
 c). The sensor group led the control group(<equ id="equ17" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Deltat^\alpha<0$
</tex>

</equ>
)79.9 (SE 1.2 )of the time. However, note that there was considerable variation in lead times, from 20  days to a few hours or no advance warning. 
</p>
<p id="15">
An alternative explanation to the sensors lead time might be that hashtags are more likely to be created by the most active users such as the ones in the sensor group, and that, being more central, they are in a better position to make them popularor from the opposite perspective, that sensors end up being more central because they create content that end up trending. In other words, that central actors select novel topics rather than being agents of contagion. In order to evaluate this possibility, we calculated the exposure rates of sensors and controls(i. e. the number of users who used the hashtag after being exposed to it). The results(see SIUsing the Sensor Method with Hashtag Networks)show that the exposure rate is significantly higher in the sensor group, meaning that sensors are better transmitters in Twitter(they are aware of what�s happening in Twitter and transmit it very soon)while controls seem to introduce more information in Twitter from other sources(or to create it), rather than transmitting what they are exposed to in Twitter. These findings therefore militate against the selection idea in favor of the contagion hypothesis. 
</p>
<p id="16">
To see how the sensor method works for hashtags that are<emph type="italic">
not
</emph>
spreading virally, we generated a null distribution in which we randomly shuffled the timestamp of each hashtag use within the fully observed data, and then measured the resulting difference in the sensor and control group samples, <equ id="equ18" type="inline">
<tex>
$\Delta_Rt^\alpha$
</tex>

</equ>
. There is a positive correlation between degree and number of tweets per day so, having higher degrees on average than controls, sensors also tend to tweet more often. Therefore, in the shuffling process sensors actually have a greater chance of getting smaller times of infection than controls because they have more tweets to be assigned a new timestamp. By shuffling the timestamps of every tweet we are measuring the lead time sensors would get not because of their centrality in a viral process but because of their higher tweeting rates. The difference, therefore, between this lead time and the observed one corresponds to the viral component of the process. Again, we repeated the procedure 1 , 000  times to generate a statistical distribution(see SIUsing the Sensor Method with Hashtag Networks). The results show that the observed distribution of lead times falls outside the null distribution for 65.4 (SE 1.2 )of the hashtags, suggesting they did, in fact, spread virally(Fig. <xref>
panel3
</xref>
 a). 
</p>
<p id="17">
The hashtags also generally showed a shift forward in the daily and cumulative incidence curves of the sensor group compared to the control one(Fig. <xref>
panel3
</xref>
 c, d). This shift forward, another sign of virality in itself, could allow for identification of an outbreak in advance, as the sensor�s deviation from the trajectory of the control group identifies a process that is spreading through the network, affecting central individuals faster than random ones. For example, estimating the models each day using all available information up to that day, foropenwebawards users, we find two consecutive days of significant(<inline-graphic id="g19" href="C:\Users\VKU3744\Desktop\LaTEX\LaTEXtoXML\mainmain\mainmain-formula-19.png"/>
)lead time by the sensor group compared to the control group on day 13 , a full 15  days before the estimated peak in daily incidence(see SIUsing the Sensor Method with Hashtag Networksand Fig. S11 to S14 of the SI), and also 15  full days before the control sample reaches the same incidence as the sensor group(See Fig. <xref>
panel3
</xref>
 c). 
</p>
<p id="18">
One can also use fixed thresholds to trigger adivergence alarmwhen the sensor group usage of a particular hashtag is growing faster than the control group usage. We tested a variety of these thresholds(see SIReproduction Rates of Hashtags as a Factor Affecting Early Detection)and found that they consistently provided advance warning of the hashtags that would be most likely to yield high usage in future. In Fig. <xref>
panel4
</xref>
 a, we show that the false positive rate for these alarms(an alarm that was triggered by a hashtag that would not be widely used)is low. In Fig. <xref>
panel4
</xref>
 b, we also show that the alarms can anticipate behavior outside Twitter as well. A survey of several Google search terms that are closely related to certain hashtags in our data shows that the peaks in Twitter usage tend to precede or coincide with Google Trends peaks, and thus increases in the Twitter sensor group and their divergence with the control group provide early warning not only on Twitter but on Google searches as well(see SITwitter, Sensors in Twitter, and Google Trendsfor several examples). 
</p>
<p id="19">
Finally, while the sensor mechanism allows us to identify a more central group, in terms of degreecentrality, that can be used to detect contagious outbreaks in advance, it may also allow us to focus on users who have other characteristics that could improve monitoring. First, in terms of network centrality, we have found sensors to have also greater betweenness. Second, in terms of activity, users in the sensor group may be more central because they are more active on twitter, and indeed we find this to be true too(Fig. <xref>
panel4
</xref>
 c). On average, users in the sensor group sent 154  tweets(SE 2.8 )during the six months they were monitored, while users in the control group tweeted only 55  times(SE 1.0 , difference of means t36 , <inline-graphic id="g20" href="C:\Users\VKU3744\Desktop\LaTEX\LaTEXtoXML\mainmain\mainmain-formula-20.png"/>
). However, we also find that sensor users tend to use a greater variety of hashtags, even controlling for activity levels(Fig. <xref>
panel4
</xref>
 d)(see SIDifferences in Sensor and Control Characteristics That Also Affect Propagation). In summary, the sensor mechanism, while targeting users with higher degree centrality, is able to identify users that are more central in many ways. 
</p>
<p id="20">
The distribution of the number of users using any one hashtag is heavy tailed(see SIThe Twitter Data)with most hashtags being used by less than a few hundred people and very few reaching the tens of thousands. Therefore, for most hashtags, the probability of finding sufficient users to perform a significant analysis in a random sample of Twitter is very small. Yet, despite the relatively small size of the infected populations, the sensor mechanism we test here seems to anticipate the global spread of information in a wide variety of cases. And, importantly, it only requires a tiny fraction of the network as a whole to be monitored, allowing us to find a sample 6  times more connected than selecting the most connected users of a sample 5  times larger(see SIFriends vs. Most Connected Nodes and Most Connected Friends as Sensors).

Discussion
</title>
<p id="21">
 We believe that this method could be applied in a wide variety of contexts in which scholars, policymakers, and companies are attempting to usebig dataonline to predict important phenomena. For example, the sensor method could be used in conjunction with online search to improve surveillance for potential flu outbreaks <citref rids="ref8 ref22">
8,22
</citref>
  . By following the online behavior of a group known to be central in a network(for example, based on email records which could be used to construct a friend sensor group), Google or other companies that monitor flurelated search terms might be able to get highquality, realtime information about a realworld epidemic with greater lead time, giving public health officials even more time to plan a response. Similarly, policymakers could monitor global mood patterns <citref rids="ref12">
12
</citref>
 to anticipate important changes in public sentiment that may influence economic growth, elections, opposition movements, or even political revolutions <citref rids="ref14">
14
</citref>
 . We also conjecture that investors might use these methods to better predict movements in the stock market <citref rids="ref13">
13
</citref>
 . 
</p>
<p id="22">
Just as we find variation in lead time for different hashtags, we expect that the ability of the sensor method to detect outbreaks early, and how early it might do so, will depend on a number of factors, includingthe online context(e. g. , whether twitter or some other data environment)the intrinsic properties of the phenomenon that is spreading and how it is measuredthe size or composition of the population, including the overall prevalence of susceptible or affected individualsthe number of people in the sensor groupthe topology of the network(for example, the degree distribution and its variance, or other structural attributes) <citref rids="ref23">
23
</citref>
 and other factors, such as whether the outbreak modifies the structure of the network as it spreads(for example, by affecting the tendency of any two individuals to remain connected after the information is transmitted). Nevertheless, it seems clear that taking advantage of the topological architecture of human populations offers the prospect of detecting a wide variety of contagious informational or behavioral outbreaks in advance of their striking the general population.
